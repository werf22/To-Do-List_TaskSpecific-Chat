## Phase 2: UI Enhancements & Core Features

*   **[DONE]** Task TreeView Implementation:
    *   Implemented Task Hierarchy TreeView feature.
    *   Created API endpoint (`/api/tasks/tree`) to fetch and structure hierarchical data.
    *   Created shared types (`types/task-tree.ts`).
    *   Built `TaskTree` React component (`components/task-tree.tsx`) using Shadcn/ui Collapsible.
    *   Integrated `TaskTree` into main page (`app/page.tsx`).
    *   Installed Shadcn dependencies (collapsible, button, skeleton).

*   **[DONE]** Filter System Improvements:
    *   **[FIXED 2025-04-22]** Fixed issue with default filters preventing tasks from displaying on initial page load.
    *   Implemented a more robust task fetching system that loads all tasks on initial page render and applies filters only on subsequent filter changes.

## Session: 2025-04-23 (Approx. 09:00 - 09:50)

*   **React/Next.js Fixes:**
    *   Resolved Next.js warning regarding direct `params.id` access in `app/tasks/[id]/page.tsx` (Client Component) by switching to the `useParams()` hook.
    *   Fixed Radix UI `<Select.Item>` error caused by using an empty string value in dropdowns within `app/tasks/[id]/page.tsx`.
    *   Fixed hydration mismatch errors caused by browser extensions injecting attributes into SVG icons (`InfoTooltip`) by adding `suppressHydrationWarning={true}`.
    *   Fixed React error "Cannot update a component (`HomePage`) while rendering a different component (`FilterBar`)" by moving the `onFilterChange` callback into a `useEffect` hook in `FilterBar`.
    *   Fixed React error "Maximum update depth exceeded" (infinite loop) by memoizing the `handleFilterChange` function in `app/page.tsx` using `useCallback`.
*   **TypeScript Fixes:**
    *   Corrected TypeScript errors in `app/page.tsx` (`fetchTasks`) related to appending array values (`string[]`) from multi-select filters (portfolio, project, section) to `URLSearchParams`.

## 2025-04-23: o4-mini Tool Update Workaround & Context Helper

*   **Implemented Workaround for o4-mini Tool Usage:**
    *   Due to issues with `o4-mini` and streaming tool calls (`streamText`), implemented a non-streaming alternative.
    *   **Frontend (`AIChatInterface.tsx`):** Added logic to `handleUpdateClick`. When `o4-mini` is selected, it makes a direct `fetch` POST request to `/api/ai/chat` with an `isManualToolUpdate: true` flag, sending messages and task context.
    *   **Backend (`/api/ai/chat/route.ts`):** Added conditional logic. If `isManualToolUpdate` is true and model is `o4-mini`, uses `generateText` to get the response/tool call, executes `updateTaskFieldsTool` using `executeTaskUpdate`, and returns a JSON response.
*   **Created Context Helper (`/lib/ai/contextHelper.ts`):**
    *   Added the `getContextForTask` function to fetch task details from Prisma based on `taskId`.
    *   Formats task details (name, status, priority, due date, etc.) into a string to prepend to the AI prompt, ensuring the AI has current task context.
*   **Fixes:** Resolved various import errors, type errors, and incorrect Prisma field name usage during implementation.

## Session: 2025-04-24 (Approx. 13:00 - 13:22)

*   **AI Chat Parameter Refinement:**
    *   Successfully configured the `AIChatInterface.tsx` component and the `/api/ai/chat` backend route to handle AI model parameters (`maxTokens`, `temperature`, `reasoningEffort`) correctly.
    *   Implemented conditional logic in `AIChatInterface.tsx` to send the `maxTokens` parameter **only** when the `gpt-4.1` model (`MODEL_IDS.GPT41`) is selected. `maxTokens` is sent at the top level of the request body.
    *   Ensured `temperature` and `reasoningEffort` are consistently sent within the `providerOptions` object when supported by the selected model.
    *   Debugged initial issues related to `maxTokens` not being included in the request payload.
    *   Fixed a typo (`MODEL_IDS.GPT_4_1` vs `MODEL_IDS.GPT41`) in the conditional logic within `AIChatInterface.tsx`.
    *   Validated successful parameter passing via browser developer tools (network tab) and backend logs.

## Session: 2025-04-24 (o4-mini Compatibility Fix)

*   **[DONE]** Fix `o4-mini` AI Tool Schema Compatibility:
    *   Identified two issues preventing `o4-mini` from using the `updateTaskFields` tool:
        1.  Schema validation errors due to optional/nullable fields not having an explicit `type` key required by the model.
        2.  After making fields required, encountered errors due to exceeding the ~500 total enum value limit for structured outputs (caused by fields like `tags`, `required_skills` having many options).
    *   Modified `lib/ai/dynamicToolSchema.ts` (`createUpdateTaskSchema`):
        *   For `o4-mini`, fields remain required and non-nullable.
        *   For `o4-mini`, if a `dropdown`, `multi-select`, or `tags` field has > 50 options, its schema type is simplified to `z.string()` or `z.array(z.string())`, with options listed in the description.
        *   For other models, fields remain optional/nullable for partial updates.
    *   This successfully resolved both errors, enabling `o4-mini` to use the `updateTaskFields` tool.
*   **[DONE]** Verified that the fix allows `o4-mini` to successfully use the `updateTaskFields` tool.

## Completed Milestones & Tasks Log

*   **[2025-04-24]** AI - Task Update Tool (`updateTaskFields`) Implementation:
    *   Successfully integrated the Vercel AI SDK `tool` capability into the `/api/ai/chat` route.
    *   Created `lib/ai/dynamicToolSchema.ts` to generate a Zod schema for tool parameters based on `TASK_FIELD_CONFIG.ts`.
    *   Created `lib/ai/tools/updateTaskFields.ts` containing the Prisma logic to execute task updates.
    *   Configured the API route to fetch task context and pass the `updateTaskFields` tool to the `streamText` function with `maxSteps` enabled.
    *   Resolved associated TypeScript errors.
    *   The AI can now understand requests to modify task fields within a task's context and execute those changes via the defined tool.
*   **[2025-04-22 16:28]** Refined `csv_field_documentation.md` and `csv_input_form_documentation.md` for clarity and AI interaction detail.
*   **[2025-04-22 17:40]** Created `prisma/seed.ts` for the development database with detailed seed data.

*   **[2025-04-22 20:10]** Fixed issue with default filters preventing tasks from displaying when the page initially loads.
*   **[2025-04-23]** Implemented backend raw SQL search logic in `/api/tasks/route.ts` for comprehensive filtering across various field types.
*   **[2025-04-23]** Fixed type mismatch errors in backend boolean field search logic.
*   **[2025-04-23]** Integrated search input and reset functionality into `FilterBar.tsx` component.
*   **[2025-04-23]** Debugged and resolved frontend state management issues related to clearing/resetting the search filter in `FilterBar.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` (`handleFilterChange`), ensuring correct task list updates.
*   **[2025-04-23]** Refined Task Field Config (`config/TASK_FIELD_CONFIG.ts`) for AI compatibility: Changed `dependents` and verified `related_tasks` are `textarea` type without `getOptions`.
*   **[2025-04-24]** Fixed Task Detail Save Error: Corrected date field processing in the backend API (`app/api/tasks/[id]/route.ts` - PATCH) to handle date strings and invalid dates properly before updating Prisma.
